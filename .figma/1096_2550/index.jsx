          1. What Are Cookies?
          <br />
        </span>
        <span className={styles.thisCookiePolicyExpl}>
          Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit
          a website. They help websites work properly, improve security, remember
          your preferences, and provide a better user experience.
          <br />
          <br />
        </span>
        <span className={styles.thisCookiePolicyExpl2}>
          2. Types of Cookies We Use
          <br />
        </span>
        <span className={styles.thisCookiePolicyExpl}>
          We use the following categories of cookies:
          <br />
        </span>
        <span className={styles.thisCookiePolicyExpl3}>Essential Cookies:</span>
        <span className={styles.thisCookiePolicyExpl}>
          &nbsp;These are required for security, navigation, fraud prevention,
          login, load balancing, and basic website functionality. You cannot disable
          these cookies because the platform cannot function without them.
          <br />
        </span>
        <span className={styles.thisCookiePolicyExpl3}>
          Performance & Analytics Cookies:
        </span>
        <span className={styles.thisCookiePolicyExpl}>
          &nbsp;These help us understand how users interact with the website — which
          pages are visited most, how users navigate, and how we may improve speed,
          flow, UI structure, accessibility, and usability. These cookies generally
          do not identify you personally.
          <br />
        </span>
        <span className={styles.thisCookiePolicyExpl3}>Functional Cookies:</span>
        <span className={styles.thisCookiePolicyExpl}>
          &nbsp;These allow the website to remember selections or preferences (e.g.
          language, last page visited, UI display preferences).
          <br />
        </span>
        <span className={styles.thisCookiePolicyExpl3}>
          Marketing & Personalization Cookies:
        </span>
        <span className={styles.thisCookiePolicyExpl}>
          &nbsp;Where applicable, these may be used to show relevant offers, improve
          personalization, or measure the effectiveness of communications and
          campaigns. These cookies may be implemented by Jaspa or our trusted
          partners.
          <br />
          <br />
        </span>
        <span className={styles.thisCookiePolicyExpl2}>
          3. Third-Party Cookies
          <br />
        </span>
        <span className={styles.thisCookiePolicyExpl}>
          We may allow certain trusted third parties (e.g. analytics providers,
          measurement partners, and advertising technology providers) to set cookies
          on our website in order to help us analyze usage and improve our digital
          services.
          <br />
          <br />
          These third parties are required to comply with applicable data protection
          and privacy laws.

          4. How You Can Manage or Disable Cookies
          <br />
        </span>
        <span className={styles.thisCookiePolicyExpl}>
          Most browsers allow you to manage or block cookies through their settings.
          <br />
          <br />
        </span>
        <span className={styles.thisCookiePolicyExpl3}>Please note:</span>
        <span className={styles.thisCookiePolicyExpl}>
          &nbsp;Disabling some cookies may affect your ability to use certain
          website features or may affect performance in some sections.
          <br />
          <br />
          Instructions for managing cookies can normally be found in your browser’s
          “Settings” or “Privacy” menu.
